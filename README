Astatistics is a generic database analysis tool originally conceived for extracting information from the Asterisk software PBX log files.

Main difference between Astatistics and other similar tools being that Astatistics was designed so that users can elaborate on existing templates to customize presentation.

Astatistics can therefore be adapted to extract the info needed in precisely the desired format -including listings and graphics- allowing export as CSV or PDF for later processing by standard methods, like spreadsheets.

Astatistics is not limited to Asterisk, but could operate on any MySQL database. It could be applied in the foreseeble future even to other database engines.

Astatistics has a powerful hierarchy of menus for organizing information along the desired operation guidelines, and a user and role management apt for use in corporate environments.

Based on the Catalyst framework for Perl programming, it is free software with a GPL license (see COPYING).

For installing instructions see INSTALL.

A manual is included in the 'doc' folder. Initially in spanish, but will be translated soon.
