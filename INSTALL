INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

First step is to install some packages and perl modules from CPAN. The second step is creating the database models for Catalyst (see next) and installing a Wkhtmltopdf wrapper. See manual in docs directory for more details as how to deploy with a web server.

Manual installation instructions on Debian Wheezy:

- Install required packages:

	# apt-get install wkhtmltopdf xvfb libcatalyst-perl libcatalyst-modules-perl libgraphics-primitive-perl libdatetime-format-mysql-perl libclass-csv-perl libchart-clicker-perl libdbd-sqlite3-perl

- Install some needed cpan modules:

	# cpanp install Catalyst::View::Graphics::Primitive Paper::Specs Catalyst::View::Wkhtmltopdf

Wkhtmltopdf binary needs X access. When deploying in a web server a wrapper with xvfb-run is needed. Please, copy scripts/wkhtmltopdf-catalyst wrapper to /usr/local/bin and make it executable (chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf).

If you need to change its path or name then open lib/Astatistics.pm and adjust command in View::Wkhtmltopdf settings.

Automatic installation on Debian Squeeze:

In Debian Squeeze there are needed some additional steps because Astatistics need different versions of some packages and cpan modules do not install cleanly due a bug in DBIx::Class and Moose build process. For simplifying installation in this Debian version we have created an automated installation script:

- Do script/install-squeeze.sh

Manual installation instructions on Debian Squeeze:

- First install base system.
- Then:
  $ sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf libtest-nowarnings-perl libexpat-dev pkg-config libcairo-dev
- Install cpan and cpanplus:
	$ sudo cpanp install CPAN
	$ sudo cpan CPANPLUS
	It will install also pre-requisites.
- Install Params::Validate:
	$ sudo cpan Params::Validate
- Install Moose:
	$ sudo cpan Moose
- Install DBIx::Class with force option because there's a bug in SQLite reconnect test:
	$ sudo cpan -fi DBIx::Class
- configure:
	$ perl Makefile.PL build
- make:
	$ sudo make
	This needs to be made as root for dependencies installation.

Finally install wkhtmltopdf wrapper:

Wkhtmltopdf binary needs X access. When deploying in a web server a wrapper with xvfb-run is needed. Please, copy scripts/wkhtmltopdf-catalyst wrapper to /usr/local/bin and make it executable (chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf).
